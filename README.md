[How to use neetcode?](https://neetcode.io/courses/lessons/how-to-use-neetcode-effectively)
Summary:
1. Quality > Quantity. Focus on edge cases.
2. Proper sequence of problems aka Roadmap is a must.
3. Don't spend more than an hour to come up with solutions to easy to medium problems.
4. Some medium to hard problems can only be solved (effectively) by learning/memorizing (not blindly, after 15-20 mins of attempt) the algorithms from already created solutions and not by coming up with one.
5. Revision of such complex algorithms is a must. Knowing each and every aspect of a simpler algorithm is better than knowing a lot of complex algorithms on the surface.
6. Consider algorithms as just a mere extension of the common programming constructs like looping, conditionals etc.
7. The only problems that then remain are to identify the algorithm to use in the problem and then to code it within 20-25 mins (30 mins max) both of which is possible with enough practice.
8. Implementation speed can also be increased by avoiding a verbose language like Java and use something like Python.
